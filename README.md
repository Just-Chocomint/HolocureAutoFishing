# HolocureAutoFishing
Fish while AFK. The script aint that good, but it does the job, average around 90 combo before breaking (depends on the coord configurations).

## **Stuff to install**
> **pip install pyautogui keyboard**

## **Usage**
Shift + P Start the fishing script
Shift + O Get mouse coords to adjust the code

## **Setup**
Adjust the coords in Line 47 - 51 to suit your res (im using 1920x1080)
You can use the shift+o command to get your mouse coordinates
Might take some adjusting to find the right spot.
