# HolocureAutoFishing
Fish while AFK. The script aint that good, but it does the job, average around 90 combo before breaking (depends on the coord configurations).  
Presses input when detect the color outline of the arrows when they enter the circle.

## **Stuff to install**
> **pip install pyautogui keyboard**

## **Usage**
Fullscreen the game  
Run main.py  
`Shift + P` Start the fishing script  
`Shift + O` Get mouse coords to adjust the code  
`Esc` to stop the code

## **Setup**
Adjust the coords in Line 46 - 50 to suit your res (im using 1920x1080)  
You can use the shift+o command to get your mouse coordinates  
Might take some adjusting to find the right spot.

When the speed is too fast, sometimes it wont detect that the pixel changed color, to solve this, try to put the y axis on the places that i have highlighted. This will greatly improve the efficiency
